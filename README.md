# PixelManager
Tries to manage pixels colors

Now it's completely overhauled using EaryChows AgX config as a basis.
Has not been tested extensively, there will be bugs.

=================

Some changes has been made to actually make this OCIO config a weapon:

1. Added colorspace for AgX Punchy in addition to the looks

2. Added AgX Punchy look transform

3. make the default working space and rendering space to ACEScg

4. some optimization for compositing software
